Make stand-alone commands for constructing unchanging json data:
  make-chart: Use dumped chart of accounts and balance sheet.
    json contains only account number mapped to account number, name, type,
    parent and children

  make-initial: Use dumped balance sheet from PRIOR year.
    json maps asset, liability, funds (including subaccounts) and vendors
    to initial balance (maybe just nonzero values)

  make-budget: Use dumped expense report
    json maps general fund income and expense account to budget value
    (maybe just nonzero values)

  chart module should do nothing but map number to name, type,
  children, parents.  maybe iterator over accounts and iterator
  over vendors
    chart -> number -> (name/type/children/parents -> value)
    do we want chart and account objects so we have accessors?

  initial should do nothing but map number to value
    use accessor?

  budget should do nothing but map number to value
    use accessor?

  use journal and entry as they are now to produce entry list.

  period activity: need to map entry list and activity period to
  period activity, initial, and final for all accounts (nested
  accounts will be tricky)

  period entries: need to map entry list and activity period and
  post period to entries in those periods

  treasurer report:
    use period entries, select bills above minimum amount to produce list
      of material expenses
    use period activity and initial, produce special fund and
      investment summaries

  ministry report:
    use period activity and initial and budget, select ministry accounts to
      produce general account and fund summaries
    use period entries, select ministry accounts to produce list of ministry
      expenses
